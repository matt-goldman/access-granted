# Access Granted

This repository was created to host the demo code used in an Sydney .NETUG in Feburary 2020.

The presentation can be seen here: https://tv.ssw.com/access-granted-demystifying-the-identity-options-matt-goldman/

This is very much a work in progress, the code will be updated continually and the examples refined. There will also be a series of blog posts at: https://goforgoldman.com to illustrate and clarify each of these (but for now, start with the video).
